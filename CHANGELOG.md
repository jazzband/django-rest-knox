## 4.0.1

- Fix for tox config to build Django 2.2 on python 3.6

## 4.0.0

**BREAKING** This is a major release version because it
breaks the existing API.
Changes have been made to the `create()` method on the `AuthToken` model. 
It now returns the model instance and the raw `token` instead
of just the `token` to allow the `expiry` field to be included in the
success response.

Model field of `AuthToken` has been renamed from `expires` to `expiry`
to remain consistent across the code base. This patch requires you
to run a migration.

Depending on your usage you might have to adjust your code
to fit these new changes.

- `AuthToken` model field has been changed from `expires` to `expiry`
- Successful login now always returns a `expiry` field for when the token expires

Authentication Module for django rest auth

Knox provides easy to use authentication for `Django REST
Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`__ The aim is to allow
for common patterns in applications that are REST based, with little
extra effort; and to ensure that connections remain secure.

Knox authentication is token based, similar to the
``TokenAuthentication`` built in to DRF. However, it overcomes some
problems present in the default implementation:

-  DRF tokens are limited to one per user. This does not facilitate
   securely signing in from multiple devices, as the token is shared. It
   also requires *all* devices to be logged out if a server-side logout
   is required (i.e. the token is deleted).

   Knox provides one token per call to the login view - allowing each
   client to have its own token which is deleted on the server side when
   the client logs out.

   Knox also provides an option for a logged in client to remove *all*
   tokens that the server has - forcing all clients to re-authenticate.

-  DRF tokens are stored unencrypted in the database. This would allow
   an attacker unrestricted access to an account with a token if the
   database were compromised.

   Knox tokens are only stored in an encrypted form. Even if the
   database were somehow stolen, an attacker would not be able to log in
   with the stolen credentials.

-  DRF tokens track their creation time, but have no inbuilt mechanism for tokens
   expiring. Knox tokens can have an expiry configured in the app settings (default is
   10 hours.)

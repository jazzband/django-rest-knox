Authentication module for Django rest auth.

Knox provides easy-to-use authentication for [Django REST
Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) The aim is to allow
for common patterns in applications that are REST-based, with little
extra effort; and to ensure that connections remain secure.

Knox authentication is token-based, similar to the `TokenAuthentication`
built into DRF. However, it overcomes some problems present in the
default implementation:

-   DRF tokens are limited to one per user. This does not facilitate
    securely signing in from multiple devices, as the token is shared.
    It also requires *all* devices to be logged out if a server-side
    logout is required (i.e. the token is deleted).

    Knox provides one token per call to the login view - allowing each
    client to have its own token which is deleted on the server side
    when the client logs out.

    Knox also provides an option for a logged-in client to remove *all*
    tokens that the server has - forcing all clients to re-authenticate.

-   DRF tokens are stored unencrypted in the database. This would allow
    an attacker unrestricted access to an account with a token if the 
    database were compromised.


    Knox tokens are only stored in a secure hash form (like a password). Even if the
    database were somehow stolen, an attacker would not be able to log
    in with the stolen credentials.

-   DRF tokens track their creation time, but have no inbuilt mechanism
    for tokens expiring. Knox tokens can have an expiry configured in
    the app settings (default is 10 hours.)

# Run the tests locally

If you need to debug a test locally and if you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed,
simply run the ``./docker-run-tests.sh`` script and it will run the test suite in every Python /
Django versions.

You could also simply run regular ``tox`` in the root folder as well, but that would make testing the matrix of
Python / Django versions a bit more tricky.

# Work on the documentation

Our documentation is generated by [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

You can refer to their [documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) on how to install it locally.

Another option is to use `mkdocs.sh` in this repository.
It will run mkdocs in a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

Running the script without any params triggers the `serve` command.
The server is exposed on localhost on port 8000.

To configure the port the `serve` command will be exposing the server to, you
can use the following env var:

```
MKDOCS_DEV_PORT="8080"
```

You can also pass any `mkdocs` command like this:

```
./mkdocs build
./mkdocs --help
```

Check the [Mkdocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for more.
